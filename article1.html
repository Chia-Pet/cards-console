        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold text-center">Understanding the Cognitive Control Center</h1>
        <p>The human mind functions like a complex system of interlinked modules, each with a specific purpose. In our simulation, the Cognitive Control Center (CCC) represents the central hub responsible for managing attention, stress, and task execution. By framing the mind as a mainframe-style interface, we can visualize the intricate processes that guide decision-making and productivity.</p>
        <p>The CCC operates alongside several critical subsystems. The Prefrontal Cortex, analogous to a rational logic processor, provides strategic guidance and allows the player to make deliberate choices through card-based actions. The Amygdala serves as an emotion-driven subroutine, triggering rapid responses that may increase stress but offer immediate action. The Hippocampus acts as memory storage and utility functions, while the Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia provide reflexive and habitual behaviors. Understanding how these modules interact is key to maintaining system stability within the game.</p>
        <p>In this simulation, stress is treated as a primary resource rather than a conventional health metric. Tasks such as debugging code, attending meetings, or completing deliverables increase the stress meter, challenging the player to balance efficiency with system stability. Cards like “Great Idea” represent high-impact actions that boost performance but also spike stress levels, whereas “Relax” cards mitigate stress, allowing the system to recover. This mechanic encourages players to consider trade-offs, much like real-life cognitive and emotional balancing.</p>
        <p>The interface itself is designed to evoke a sense of nostalgia for early computing systems. Cards are displayed as virtual modules with blinking status indicators, mirroring the lights of a mainframe or early terminal system. Colors such as green, yellow, and gray provide immediate feedback on module status, enabling intuitive understanding of the CCC’s operational health. The functional key system, accessible through both clickable icons and keyboard shortcuts, allows seamless navigation between different subsystems, providing quick access to specialized tools and information.</p>
        <p>One of the key challenges in designing this system is the balance between aesthetic fidelity and usability. While the interface is intentionally stylized to resemble vintage computing environments, interactive features such as hover effects, blinking indicators, and dynamic content updates are integrated to ensure clarity and responsiveness. For instance, the F-key toggle allows users to enable or disable keyboard shortcuts, and the dark mode toggle adapts the visual theme to user preference. These options enhance the immersive experience without compromising the retro aesthetic.</p>
        <p>By exploring the CCC through a card-based game framework, users gain insight into both cognitive functioning and system-level thinking. Each run encourages experimentation with strategy and resource management, highlighting the interplay between rational planning, reflexive responses, and emotional impulses. The meta-layer progression, which allows players to carry forward perks and improved cards into new runs, reinforces long-term planning and encourages replayability.</p>
        <p>Overall, this approach to visualizing cognitive processes emphasizes clarity, engagement, and interactivity. By combining stylistic elements inspired by mainframe interfaces with game mechanics that reflect real-world cognitive dynamics, the CCC simulation creates an experience that is both educational and entertaining. Players not only manage stress and tasks but also develop an appreciation for the modular complexity of human cognition, all within an environment that feels nostalgic, dynamic, and alive.</p>
